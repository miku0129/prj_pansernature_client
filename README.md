## Overview
This repository contains the codebase of a website for <strong>Panser Nature</strong> - NGO group that practices natural farming and opens up its knowledge to all those seeking a healthier life. ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±

## Motivation
Archiving the articles of **Michel PROVOST** so that everyone can access his discoveries.

Michel PROVOST (1943-2025) was an influential practitioner of natural farming. He was a president of Panther Nature and published books with his passion for natural farming.

## Features

- To implement **CI/CD**, this application is deployed on a **VPS**.

    - Hosting setup is scripted with **Docker** and managed via **Portainer**.
    - A user-friendly and memorable URL is routed using **Nginx Proxy Manager**.
    - **Firestore** is used for hosting articles and interacting with the application.
    - **EmailJS** and **SendGrid** enable seamless in-app contact functionality.

## Closing
I appreciate Michel and the organization Panser Nature for allowing me to be part of this great project of archiving Michel's articles.
